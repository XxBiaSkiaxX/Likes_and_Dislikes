# *My likes ;*
My likes are really simple! I love; Kakegurui, Warframe *(User: Lilly_Playz1)*, Overwatch, Apex *(A bit)*, Greek Mythology, Vocaloid, Fantastic 4, DDLC, TLOU, Tomb Raider, Slime Rancher, Cookie Run Kingdom, and a few more! I do get fixated easily, so I hope that's not an issue.
I also like: making friends, being brutally afraid of everything *(Joking)*, music *(Rafscrap, LuLuYam, Chloe Breez and Reinaeiry)*, my animals, gaming, jorking my peanuts *(For legal reasons, this is a joke)* and my girlfriend! <33

# *My dislikes ;*
Void ponies because they're annoying and lowkey assholes, Epic: The Musical freaks, obsessieve/pushy people, sensitive people *(I make mean jokes, soo...)*, people who judge me on my twitch *(Like stfu)* and cocky assholes *(Unless you're joking-)*

# *My fears ;*
Storms, oceans, the dark and literally a lot of other things LMAO
